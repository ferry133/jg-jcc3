"""Which of this repo's check scripts CI runs, and why the rest are not run.

Measured 2026-08-31 in a fresh checkout with no `cluster.yaml`, no `age.key`,
no rendered `kubernetes/` and no cluster: seven of the twelve `check-*` scripts
pass on their own, and five cannot see their subject from here. The five are
listed with the reason rather than dropped, because a list that silently stops
at the runnable ones reads exactly like a list that covers everything.

`--audit` fails if any guard in `scripts/` is in neither list. That is the
failure this file exists for: `#58` added a check script and nothing ran it,
which is how a repo with eleven guards ended up with no CI at all.

The inventory is deliberately not a plain `check-*` glob. It was, for one day,
and the acceptance review found the hole the same evening: a guard whose name
does not start with `check-` was invisible to the audit, **and the output was
byte-identical to full coverage** — `ok 12 check scripts` either way. That is
this file's own failure mode occurring inside this file. It was not
hypothetical: `delivery-check.py` has always been such a file.

So the inventory is "starts with `check-`, or has `check` anywhere in the name",
and the naming convention is no longer load-bearing. A guard called something
else entirely is still invisible; that residue is named here rather than left
to be rediscovered.
