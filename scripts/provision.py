"""Provisioning flow driver — §4 of the factory-agent change.

`fleet-ops docs/operations/provision-customer-cluster.md` is the procedure. A person
ran it end to end (§7.2, 2026-08-22) in the time before this file existed, on
purpose: automating a procedure nobody has run multiplies whatever is wrong with
it and then hides that behind a script. There have been more runs since; what
matters here is the order, not a count that keeps going up. This file automates
the steps that run against Omni, GitHub and Cloudflare, and refuses the ones
that need a human.

The one rule this file is built around
--------------------------------------
**Never create on an observation you could not make.**

Every external resource here — the Omni cluster, the user repo, the tunnel, the
DNS records — is created at most once per delivery (D4). The only way to keep
that true across a restart is to look before creating. But "look" has three
outcomes, not two:

    PRESENT       it is there, and it is the one this ticket means
    ABSENT        it is not there, and the query that would have found it worked
    UNMEASURABLE  the query did not work

An `UNMEASURABLE` treated as `ABSENT` is precisely how a re-run produces a second
tunnel: `cloudflared tunnel list` without a `cert.pem` prints an error and no
tunnels, which is byte-identical to a correct answer of "none". So this driver
**stops** on `UNMEASURABLE` and never falls through to create. That is 4.10 and
4.12 in one decision, and it is why `Observation` is a three-valued type rather
than a bool.

A fourth outcome exists and is not a failure of measurement:

    CONFLICT      something is there, but it is not what this ticket describes

CONFLICT is also a stop. "There is a repo by that name owned by someone else"
and "there is no repo" need opposite corrections, so choosing one is guessing.

What this file will not do
--------------------------
- **It will not create a cluster for a machine that matches no ticket** (4.2).
  That refusal is load-bearing outside §4: `zero-it-onboarding` D13 concluded a
  join token need not expire *because* nothing auto-assigns an unknown machine.
  Weakening 4.2 silently invalidates that, and whoever does it will not know.
- **It will not retry an unrecognised failure** (4.12). It prints what it ran,
  what it expected and what it got, verbatim, and exits.
- **It will not register an account with any consumer service** (5.2). Not
  Google, not Cloudflare, not Auth0, not a domain registrar. There is no code
  path here that creates one, and there should not be — automating consumer
  sign-up means holding the credential that recovers the account, which is the
  one thing `factory-agent` D11 (`ferry133/jg-cluster-template#5`) exists to
  avoid. **Who registers what,
  and when, is that decision's to state, not this file's**: restating a live
  decision here puts a copy of it in every new customer repo, and that is the
  copy nobody comes back to. The change name is load-bearing — three fleet-ops
  changes each have a D11 (`zero-it-onboarding`'s is about positive controls),
  and a bare `D11` reads perfectly in all three. The change itself lives in
  `fleet-ops openspec/changes/factory-agent/` — private, so a customer reading
  this cannot open it; the pointer still has to resolve for whoever can.
- **It mutates nothing without `--apply`.** The default prints the commands.

A missing input, and what now detects it
---------------------------------------
`build_ctx` computes a path to an Omni cluster template at
`<--dir>/omni-cluster.yaml` (4.3), and **nothing this repo ships provides that
file**. Measured 2026-09-12 on `jg-cluster-template` `main`: zero tracked files match
`omni-cluster.ya?ml` (positive control, same query shape:
`cluster.sample.yaml` → 1). That is one repo on one branch on one day; the
customer repos are measured below (**nothing automated puts it there**), and
they do not ship it either.

`--dir` is **the generated customer repo's working directory**. Neither the
default (`.`) nor `build_ctx` can tell you that — `build_ctx` only calls
`abspath` and `join`, and a default of `.` says "stand in the right place", not
which place. The definition is in what the steps *read*: measured 2026-09-13 on
`jg-janncotcc`, 4.6 reads that repo's `cluster.yaml`, 4.7 its git tree, 4.8 its
`kubeconfig-sa`. Point `--dir` at the template repo instead and 4.6 is `ABSENT`
at its first step — but the three do not fail alike, and the difference is this
file's whole subject. `cluster.yaml` and `kubeconfig-sa` are simply not there,
so those steps say so. The template repo *does* have a `.git`, so 4.7 never
reaches `UNMEASURABLE`: it runs its leak query against the wrong repository,
finds nothing (measured 2026-09-14 — `git log --all -- '*cluster.yaml'` → 0,
positive control `'*cluster.sample.yaml'` → 84) and reports `PRESENT`, tree
clean. **A missing input announces itself; a wrong one answers.**

So the paragraph above is a statement about the *template* repo; the file has
to arrive in the customer repo, and **nothing automated puts it there** —
no repo ships it and no step here writes it. Measured 2026-09-14 across the
three customer repos (`jcom`, `jg-jiahd`, `jg-janncotcc`): `omni-cluster.ya?ml`
has **0 commits** in each history and is tracked by none (per-repo positive
control, the `.editorconfig` each one does track: 1, 2, 1 commits — counted
with `git log --all`, which is the point: sticking to `HEAD` gives 1, 1, 1
because `jg-jiahd` has one of them on a branch, and two people comparing these
numbers without the query shape will disagree and both be right).
`jg-janncotcc` has one in its working tree, untracked — caught by the
`*cluster.yaml` rule in its `.gitignore`, which is there for `cluster.yaml` and
swallows this name too. (Named by rule, not by line — for the reason the next
paragraph gives about line numbers; a citation that contradicts its own section
is worse than no citation.) A person put it there, by hand.

Who does that, and how: `fleet-ops
docs/operations/provision-customer-cluster.md`, **Step 3b**, which carries how
the file is produced (export a template from an existing cluster, then four
edits). Cited by section and not by line: that document is edited daily, and a
line number does not go blank when it rots — it starts pointing at an unrelated
sentence, which is worse than pointing at nothing.

**The path is read on both sides of that question now, for different
reasons** — this used to be the paragraph saying an existing cluster meant the
file was never looked at, and `#128` ended that:

- **Omni already holds a cluster of this name.** `OmniClusterStep.observe`
  opens the template and compares the name it describes, in **every** mode
  including `plan`, because a name match is not an identity check. Same name →
  `PRESENT`. Different → `CONFLICT`. **No template, or one this parser cannot
  read → `UNMEASURABLE`**, and the run stops: the question was not asked, and
  `PRESENT` here would mean only "something is called that".
- **No such cluster (`ABSENT`).** Here the two modes still differ, and the
  difference is the whole point:
  - **Without `--apply`** — that is `plan`, and also `run` with no flag: the
    driver branches on the flag, and argparse offers that flag on `run` only,
    so those two spellings are the whole of it. It prints `WOULD` and the
    `omnictl cluster template sync -f <path>` it would run, then **continues to
    the next step**. It does not stop, and on this path it does not open the
    file.
  - **`run --apply`** stops before running that command if the template is not
    there: `drive()` checks `step.inputs(ctx)` at the moment it is about to
    act — after the `plan` branch, so "show me what you would do" still does
    not need the file — and names the missing path (`#129`).

**What is still predicted rather than observed**: what `omnictl cluster
template sync` does once the file *is* there. §4.14 has never run against a
real Omni. The stopping above is measured; the success beyond it is not.

Until 2026-09-14 this section ended by saying that nothing here ever opened or
stated that path, and that `omnictl`'s failure was the first report of the gap.
`#129` and `#128` made both false, and the two bullets above are what replaced
them — **said once, there, and not restated here**: two copies of the same
explanation in one section is how they start to disagree.

**Detecting the gap is not providing the file.** The rest of this section
stands because the input is still missing and **no step here produces it** —
a person does, per Step 3b above.

Both halves are spelled out because each has already misled someone. The
sentence this replaces said `run`/`plan` "stop there", with no mention of
whether the cluster exists — one reader took that to mean `plan` always stops
at 4.3. The first attempt at a fix then said the new-cluster case "stops there",
which is false for `plan` for the same reason. Same sentence, two halves, one
reader each.

It is written here because the alternative is finding out half-way through a
delivery, in front of a customer — and because a script whose missing input is
only known to the person who wrote it is the shape this repo keeps paying for.
What *has* run against a real Omni: the **observe** path 4.3–4.8, measured
2026-09-13 on `ferry133/jg-janncotcc#2` — six steps PASS, writing nothing
(ruling and evidence: `#116` comment 5653393277). ⚠️ **That reading predates
`#128`**, which changed 4.3's observe to open the template and compare the name
it describes; **that comparison has not been run against a real Omni.** The
`create` side (§4.14) has not either — said once, above.

        A name match is not an identity check. It reads like one because in a
        single Omni the cluster id *is* the name, so `metadata.id` cannot be
        asked twice — comparing it again adds nothing. Every other field the
        listing carries was measured and rejected (2026-09-14, against Omni's
        own `ClusterSpec` in `client/api/omni/specs/omni.proto`):

        - `kubernetesVersion` / `talosVersion` — a cluster legitimately
          upgraded after provisioning differs from its template, so this would
          flag a *correct* cluster, and a guard that fires on correct input
          gets switched off;
        - `features`, `backupConfiguration` — describe settings, not which
          delivery this is;
        - the `cniConfig: none` patch this class exists around — **not in
          `ClusterSpec` at all**. It is a separate `ConfigPatches.omni.sidero.dev`
          resource bound by label, so reading it is a second query whose JSON
          shape nobody here can verify against a live Omni.

        What is left is the template: it is this delivery's only written
        description of the cluster it means. So the comparison is against that
        file, and when the file is not here the honest answer is that the
        question was not asked.

        **What this still does not answer**, written here rather than left for
        a reader to discover: a template that names this cluster does not prove
        the cluster in Omni is the one this delivery created. Someone else's
        cluster of the same name, or one built by hand, passes this. Closing
        that needs the machines' `delivery-ticket` label — which `plan` and
        `run` cannot reach today, because neither takes `--ticket`.

        The template naming this cluster says the *description* here is this
        delivery's. It does not say the cluster in Omni is. Someone else's
        cluster of the same name, or one built by hand, passes everything
        above — which is what `#140` was opened for.

        What identifies is the ticket: machines carry a `delivery-ticket`
        label written at image-build time by `omnictl media preset create
        --initial-labels`, and 4.2's refusal is already built on it. Omni
        relates a machine to a cluster with `omni.sidero.dev/cluster` (read
        2026-09-14 from `client/pkg/omni/resources/omni/labels.go`:
        `SystemLabelPrefix` + `LabelSuffixCluster`) — not a string guessed

# -------------------------------------------------- 4.13 machine not appeared

ABSENT_MACHINE_REPORT = """\
The machine has not appeared in Omni.

**This report enumerates causes. It does not name one.** Every item below
produces exactly the same observation from here — an absence — and the whole
point of writing them all down is that the absence does not distinguish them.

Causes, in the order they are cheapest to rule out:

  1. The box has not been unpacked, plugged in or switched on.
  2. The network cable is in a port that is not live, or in the wrong socket.
  3. The customer's DHCP did not hand out a lease.
  4. The customer's network blocks the machine's egress to Omni.
     Shipped disks are imaged with `--use-siderolink-grpc-tunnel`, so
     SideroLink runs over HTTP/2 on 443 rather than UDP (`zero-it-onboarding`
     D12 ruled this on by default precisely because the UDP failure is
     indistinguishable from "not plugged in" from this end). If the disk for
     this delivery predates that ruling, UDP blocking is back on this list.
  5. The join token burned into that disk has been revoked or expired.
  6. The disk does not hold what was shipped — it booted to nothing, or it was
     re-imaged. Step −1's assertion (`installed = True`, `maintenance = True`)
     is what would have caught this before the box left, so check whether that
     assertion was recorded for this machine, not whether it was performed.
  7. Omni itself is not reachable from here, in which case *every* machine is
     absent. Check that other machines are still listed before reading this
     machine's absence as being about this machine.

**Do not tell the customer which one it is.** Ask them for the three things
they can observe without opening anything:

  - Is there a light on the front of the box?
  - Is there a light next to the network cable where it plugs into the box?
  - Is there a light where the other end plugs in?

Those three answers separate causes 1–3 from 4–7. Nothing else on this list can
be told apart from the factory, and guessing on the customer's behalf turns a
five-minute check into a site visit.
