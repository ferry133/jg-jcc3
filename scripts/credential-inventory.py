"""Per-cluster credential inventory — §5.4 and §5.6 of factory-agent.

Emits one cluster's credentials in the five-column form already in use at
`jg-base kubernetes/apps/extras/factory/factory/README.md`: credential, what it
is for, scope, blast radius if read, rotation. One shape, not two — two shapes
diverge, and the one being read is usually the older.

Rotation (5.6) is the fifth column rather than a separate document, because a
rotation procedure filed away from the credential it rotates is one nobody finds
at the moment they need it.

**The thing this script must not do is be a list of names someone thought of.**
The `config.gen/cluster.yaml` leak happened because a rule and a check both
named the file someone expected. So the table below is not the answer on its
own: every field actually present in the cluster's `cluster.yaml` is compared
against it, and anything unrecognised is printed as UNCLASSIFIED. An inventory
that silently omits a credential reads exactly like an inventory of a cluster
that does not have one.

The other half of the same rule, taken from the jg-base document: **a row that
was considered and deliberately left out looks identical, from outside, to one
that was forgotten.** So exclusions are printed with their reason, not dropped.

No credential VALUE is ever printed — only whether one is set. This output is
meant to be pasteable into a delivery ticket in a public repository.

Usage
-----
  credential-inventory.py --dir PATH [--format md|text]

Exit 0 when the inventory is complete, 1 when a credential this cluster needs is
missing, 2 when the inventory could not be built (no cluster.yaml, unreadable
schema) — never 0 with a caveat.
