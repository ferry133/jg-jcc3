"""Executable form of the provisioning runbook's assertions — §7.1a.

`fleet-ops docs/operations/provision-customer-cluster.md` is a document made almost
entirely of checks, executed by a person, with nothing behind them. This runs
the ones a machine can run, so that 7.2 has real assertions to execute and 7.3
has something an agent can run identically.

The design rule every check here obeys
--------------------------------------
**A check that cannot discriminate reads identically to a check that passed.**
So each check below either carries a positive control, or refuses to report a
pass. Concretely, that means:

  - Absence is never reported as good on its own. `NotFound`, "no output" and
    "no rows" are also what asking the wrong question looks like, so something
    that must be present is asserted in the same breath.
  - Nothing trusts a tool's own account of itself where a checksum, a digest or
    a delegation record is available instead.
  - A check pinned to one path is treated as not having looked. `cluster.yaml`
    leaked at `config.gen/cluster.yaml` past a rule and a check both naming
    `/cluster.yaml`.

Every subcommand exits 0 on pass, 1 on fail, and 2 when it could not tell —
which is deliberately not the same as a pass.

    itself would answer about the working tree, which is a different file and a
    different question. `core.excludesFile=/dev/null` keeps the operator's
    global ignore list out of an answer that is supposed to be about this text.

    Three outcomes, not two. A scratch repo that cannot be created, or a git
    that answers 128, is "cannot measure" — and to earn the `False` the
    instrument must first be shown able to say `True`: a sentinel rule is
    appended and asked about, and if *that* comes back unignored then the
    instrument is not answering and `None` is returned. Without that, every

    nslookup prints its server twice before any answer:

        Server:         10.9.1.53
        Address:        10.9.1.53#53      <- the resolver, not a result

    The previous form of this filter could not drop that line: it captured with
    `([0-9.]+)`, which stops before `#`, and then tested
    `a.endswith("#53")` — on a string from which `#53` had already been removed.
    **Dead code that read as a guard**, found 2026-09-13 by the first test ever
    written for this subcommand (#104).

    Both consequences were live, and the second is worse:

    1. A resolver whose own address happens to equal `--expect-addr` passed this
       check while resolving nothing.
    2. **The positive control could never fail.** `ctl_addrs` was non-empty for
       any resolver that replied at all, because the server line was always
       counted — so "github.com resolves, so forwarding works" was printed
       without being measured. That is this file's own doctrine breaking inside
       this file: a check that cannot fail reads exactly like one that passes.

    Capturing the whole token and rejecting anything containing `#` keeps the
    filter honest for `#53` and for a non-default port alike.

    Old vs new on the same four inputs (measured 2026-09-13; the third row is
    why the old form was worse than "it drops answers"):

        only the server line   old ['10.9.1.50']            new []
        server + IPv4 answer   old ['10.9.1.53','10.9.1.50'] new ['10.9.1.50']
        server + IPv6 answer   old ['10.9.1.53','2001']     new ['2001:db8::1']
        server on port 5353    old ['10.9.1.53','10.9.1.50'] new ['10.9.1.50']

    Row 3: the old capture stopped at the colon, so an IPv6 answer became the
    string `2001` — **an address that does not exist**, printed straight into the
    FAIL message below (`did not resolve to … (got: …)`). Whoever read that went
    looking for `2001`. A misleading diagnosis costs more than none.

    Row 4 is why the new form rejects any `#` rather than the literal `#53`: the
    old test could not have caught a resolver on a non-default port either. **The
    fix is deliberately wider than the defect — do not narrow it back for
    "precision".**

# actions are opposite -- collapsing them into one count is the same mistake
# as collapsing "cannot measure" into "passed" (FO-runbook [5fe39a],
