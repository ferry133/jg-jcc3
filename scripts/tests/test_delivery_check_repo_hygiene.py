"""Tests for delivery-check.py's `repo-hygiene` subcommand — #104 (4), batch 2a.

Run: python3 .github/workflows/run-tests.py

No fake tools here: this subcommand only ever runs `git -C <dir>`, so every case
builds a real repository in a temp dir and lets the real git answer. A stub would
be testing the stub — and the defects this check exists for are all about what
git actually records versus what the working copy shows.

Three properties are worth more than the happy path, and each has a mutation in
the PR that turns exactly one of these tests red:

1. **A failed positive control must report "cannot measure", not "clean".**
   `git log --all -- '*cluster.yaml'` returning nothing is also what a wrong
   pathspec, an empty repo or a broken invocation returns. The check asserts the
   same query shape finds `*.md`; if that finds nothing either, the clean result
   above it proves nothing.
2. **The history query must match any path**, not the expected one. jg-jiahd's
   eleven credential-bearing blobs were at `config.gen/cluster.yaml`.
3. **The deep scan must NOT fire on SOPS ciphertext.** Every cluster repo is
   *supposed* to commit `cluster-secrets.sops.yaml` with all these field names
   present and encrypted. Measured on jg-janncotcc 2026-08-22: five fields
   matched, all five values began `ENC[`, and the delivery reported a leak. A
   guard that fires on the correct state gets switched off, and a switched-off
   guard reads exactly like a passing one.

# Loading the subject with `spec_from_file_location` writes
# `scripts/__pycache__/delivery-check.*.pyc` unless this is set first. That
# cached bytecode is not a tidiness question: CPython reuses a `.pyc` when the
# source mtime (to the second) AND size both match, which is exactly what a
# minimal mutation looks like — so a negative control can report the PREVIOUS
# mutation's result (jgct#96, and #102 was bitten by it).
#
# `.github/workflows/run-tests.py` sets this too, so the sanctioned entry point
# is already clean (measured: 0 `.pyc` after a full run). This line covers the
# other way in, `python3 -m unittest scripts/tests/<file>`, which no runner
# guards. **It cannot prevent this test module's OWN `.pyc`** — that is written
# while unittest imports it, before this line executes. Only `python3 -B` or
# `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` covers that, and every test file in this directory
# shares the gap, so it is written here rather than fixed silently in one of them.
