"""`.gitignore`'s secret rules must cover SUFFIX variants, and must not catch tracked files — jgct#184.

Run: python3 .github/workflows/run-tests.py

**The defect, measured.** `*cluster.yaml` covered only prefix variants, so
`cluster.yaml.bak`, `cluster.yaml.orig` and `cluster.yaml.20260919` were all
committable — and a suffix is what a hand-made backup actually looks like: `cp`
to `.bak`, an editor's `.orig`, a date appended. `cluster.yaml` is the one file
holding every plaintext credential a cluster has, and this `.gitignore` is
copied into every customer repo, all of them public.

Asking every rule in the file the same question turned up **fifteen** with that
shape, not three filenames — including `age.key`, whose exposure is worse than
`cluster.yaml`'s: a leaked `cluster.yaml` credential can be rotated, while
`age.key` decrypts every off-site backup already uploaded, and those cannot be.

**This file's own header already said so.** Lines 3-8 of `.gitignore` read
"Rules are shaped by WHAT IS PROTECTED, not by filenames someone thought of …
Prefer a glob over an exact name". Fifteen of its rules did not follow it. The
lesson was written down and applied to three rules (`kubeconfig*`,
`talosconfig*`, `omniconfig*`) and to no others.

**Why a test and not just wider rules.** Widening rules made two of them match
TRACKED template files — `templates/…/controller/cluster.yaml.j2` and
`templates/config/.sops.yaml.j2`. Both were found by asking all tracked files;
a hand-picked list of seven "files that must stay tracked" missed the first and
would have missed the second. And a `.gitignore` rule that matches a tracked
file breaks nothing on the day it lands, because tracking wins — which is
exactly why it would have sat there until someone re-added the file. So the
collision check belongs in CI, not in whoever-remembers.

**The instrument is the repo's own.** `_ignore_text_covers` writes HEAD's
`.gitignore` into a throwaway repo with `core.excludesFile=/dev/null` and asks
git. Bare `git check-ignore` answers about the workstation running it, which is
also the workstation doing the checking — that is jgct#167, and jg-jiahd's
eleven credential-bearing blobs landed behind exactly that confusion.
