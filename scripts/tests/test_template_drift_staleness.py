"""A stale template checkout must not be allowed to say "edited locally" — jgct#195.

Run: python3 .github/workflows/run-tests.py

`stale_or_edited()` answers by looking the cluster's bytes up in the template
checkout's own history. When that checkout is behind, the newer blobs are not
in its object database, the lookup falls through, and a **synced** file is
reported with the strongest phrase the tool can produce:

    DRIFTED  .taskfiles/template/resources/cluster.schema.cue
             (306 changed lines; edited locally: these bytes are no version
              this path ever had)

Measured by `FO-runbook [5fe39a]` on 2026-09-24: that blob was byte-identical
to jgct `origin/main`, and the local checkout was 146 commits behind.

⚠️ The direction of the error is what makes it worse than a normal false
positive. The tool's own help says `stale` needs no judgement and
`edited locally` is "the one that needs a reason". So the reader goes looking
for a reason that does not exist, and the likeliest resolution is to record the
file as a deliberate local exception — **a synced file becomes a permanent
one**.

Both directions are asserted here. Testing only the fresh side would leave
"passes" and "this classification was never wired up" identical.
